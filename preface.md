#### What is RFM?

**Relative Fat Mass (RFM)** is a simple formula for the estimation of 
overweight or obesity in humans that requires only a calculation based 
on a ratio of height and waist measurements.

**High body fat** is associated with increased risks of poor health and
early mortality. **RFM** is a simple anthropometric procedure that is 
claimed to be more convenient than body fat percentage and more accurate 
than the traditional body mass index (BMI).

*	RFM for adult males: 64 – 20 × (height / waist circumference)
*	RFM for adult females: 76 – 20 × (height / waist circumference)
